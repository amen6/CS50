# CS50
The **CS50** introduction to computer science course was very helpful for me as a beginner,  it gave me a better idea about programming and computers, helped me to think more algorithmically and  can understand the code better now.
The videos were fun to watch, and also very useful.
Starting with C was hard for me, some problems were hard to solve, at the end i was able to solve them.
Python was really interesting, it was easier to understand than C, i redone the C problem sets but using Python.
As a self-taught learner it gave me the opportunity to learn how to search for the problems facing me, reading documentation, and learn things from different places, i learned how to use libraries too.
I used HTML, CSS, Python, Flask, SQL in the final project(**finance**), it was a good experience to build a project by my own.
The **CS50** was a little bit hard as my first course, but at the end it **paid off**.
