# CS50
The **CS50** introduction to computer science course was very helpful for me as a beginner,  it gave me a better idea about programming and computers, helped me to think more algorithmically and  can understand the code better now.  
Starting with C was hard for me, some problems were hard to solve, at the end i was able to solve them.
Python was really interesting, it was easier to understand than C, i redone the C problem sets but using Python.
As a self-taught learner it gave me the opportunity to learn how to search for the problems facing me, reading documentation, and learn things from different places.
I used HTML, CSS, Python, Flask in the final project(**finance**), it was a good experience to build a project by my own.
The **CS50** was a little bit hard as my first course, but at the end it paid off.
